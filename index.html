            <h2>Sporting CP (Youth-2003): The Beginning</h2>
            <img src="CR-Sporting.jpg" alt="Young Ronaldo in the Sporting CP jersey">
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is a football legend and, by many, considered to be the greatest player of all time. At the young age of 16, Cristiano was promoted to the senior team of his home club: Sporting CP and made his senior debut on October 7, 2002. In only one season for the Portugese club, the young player scored 5 goals in 31 matches and caught the eye of Premier League club Manchester United. There, he became the most expensive teenage signing in the English Premier League.

            <h2>Manchester United (2003-2009): Development</h2>
            <img src="CR-MU.jpg" alt="Charasmatic Ronaldo in the Man United Jersey">
            <p>Ronaldo made his senior debut for ManU in August of 2003 where he donned the number 7 shirt, a number reserved for some of the best players. Ronaldo scored his first goal in the Premier league that November and began his 6 year legacy at the club. Over these 6 years, he helped Manchester United win 9 trophies, including the Champions League, the FA Cup and Community Shield, the FIFA Club World Cup, the Premier League (three times), and more. His goal count in Manchester also was revolutionary, breaking the 100 goal mark for the club (118) and breaking his own 100 goal mark to a total of 123 career club goals. He also was given many individual awards, including the Ballon D’Or (the highest honor in international football), the European Golden Boot, the Puskas Award for best goal of the season (a 40 yard banger that Ronaldo argues was the best goal he has ever scored), and more. Overall, his time at the club was a heavily successful growing stage that led him to become the legendary player that he was when he made his 2009 transfer to La Liga side Real Madrid.

            <h2>Real Madrid (2009-2010): The First Season in Greatness</h2>
            <img src="ronaldo-RM.jpg" alt="Ronaldo Donning the Real Madrid Kit with the Number 9">
            <p>In 2009, Ronaldo was transferred to Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee of €94 million and a buyout clause of  €1 billion. Here, he was welcomed by a world record debut crowd of 80,000 fans as he donned the number 9 shirt. He scored not only in that debut game, but in the next three games as well, becoming the first Real Madrid player to score in their first 4 fixtures. He also scored in his first Champions League game with the club, but was injured shortly after in an international game with Portugal, leading to a 7 week sideline for the player. Despite this, he came in second for the Ballon D’Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year Award that season, only behind footballing legend Lionel Messi, a player for Barcelona (the rival team of Real Madrid).It was during this season that Ronaldo and Messi developed a competitive rivalry and began their duo trek to become the two greatest footballers this world has ever seen. During this season, Ronaldo totaled 33 goals for Madrid, including his first hat-trick for the spanish side in a 4-1 victory over Mallorca, and was handed his old number (7) by Raul for the 2010-2011 season. It was then that Ronaldo was formally able to restate his nickname CR7. He continued at Real Madrid through 2018. </p>

                <h2>Real Madrid (2010-2018): Pinnacle of success</h2>
                <img src="CR7-Captain-RM.jpg" alt="Ronaldo with the #& kit at Madrid with the Captain's Band">
                <p>During the 2010-2011 season at Real Madrid, Ronaldo made strides that were unheard of at the time. He scored four goals in a single match, scored in 6 consecutive matches, and scored 11 goals in a single month.Although he did not place on the podium for the 2010 Ballon D’Or, he scored a total 40 league goals in the season, breaking the record for most La Liga (Spanish League) goals in a single season and winning the European Golden Shoe. This also made him the first player ever to win the Golden Shoe in two different leagues. That season was also notable because it was where he won his first trophy in Spain - the Copa del Rey. 
                    The next season was even more notable for Ronaldo, as he surpasses 60 club goals across all competitions, beating his own record, and achieving 100 goals at the club in 92 games in less than three seasons, beating the record of Ferenc Puskas, the player whose name is on the Puskas Trophy that Ronaldo won at Manchester United. He also was a key part of Real Madrid’s first league win in 4 years, claiming 100 league points and beating out rivals Barcelona by a landslide. Despite this, Ronaldo still came in second behind Messi for the 2011 Ballon D’Or, and Madrid failed to win the Champions League semi-final. The next season, Ronaldo lifted two more trophies for Madrid, hit the 150 goal mark for the club, and placed, again, second in the Ballon D’Or. The real success bagan the next season, though.
                    While there are too many honors, achievements, and records to detail from 2013-2018, many do stick out as most notable. The first of these being his captaining of Real Madrid in 2013, his 200 goal mark for Real Madrid, his 300th club goal for all clubs, scoring in 6 consecutive Clasicos against Barcelona, and achieving a 69 goal season in the 2013-14 run - something completely unheard of. Ronaldo also began to show that his ego was not going to his head - in a match against his previous team Manchester United, Ronaldo scored the game winning goal that pushed Madrid through in the Champions League. However, he refused to celebrate at all in any way as a sign of respect to his old club. It was at this time that Ronaldo’s true character of kindness, respect, and being a man of honor took shape.Ronaldo went on to win his first Real Madrid Ballon D’Or (second overall) in 2013, and then again in 2014, 2016, and 2017, equalling (at the time) the record help by Lionel Messi for most Ballon D’Ors. During these years, Ronaldo went on to win the Champions League a record five times, being the first player to do so. He also finished the 2017-18 Champions League season as top scorer in the league for the sixth season in a row - another record. Among other records, Ronaldo has a recorded header jump with his feet 7 feet and 7 inches above the ground, something absolutely crazy in the footballing world and receiving standing ovations from the opposing team and their players. After his 2018 Champions League win against Liverpool and a Real Madrid record of 450 goals in 438 appearances, Ronaldo was transferred to Juventus in Turin, Italy for another record signing of €112 million - a record for a player over 30 and a record for an Italian club transfer.

                <img src="CR-Juve.jpg" alt="Ronaldo in a Juventus Kit">
                <p>Ronaldo, currently playing at Juventus, has been there since 2018. He scored the 400th league goal of his career in his fourth appearance for the club and began to break records in Italy. He scored 10 goals in 14 games, became the first player to score in 100 Champions League matches, Within the next two seasons (the 2019-2020 season being severely hindered by COVID-19), he scored his 600th club goal, 700th career goal, and won multiple trophies including runner up to the Ballon D’Or, the Supercoppa Italia, and the Seria A (Italy League) title twice. He also broke the record of most club goals scored with an Italian team, scoring 37 goals in one season. During this time at Juventus he also became the fourth highest goalscorer in history. He is still stationed at Juventus scoring regularly and proving time and time again that he can prove his greatness no matter the league, no matter his age, no matter his team, scoring 68 goals so far for the team.
