    <p>
        My name is Cameron Hall and I am a sophomore at Michigan State University. I am majoring in Media and Information with a focus in Film Production and a minor in Fiction Filmmaking. I am also pursuing a major in Film Studies and a secondary minor in Information and Communication Technology and Development. I have been an avid fan of soccer/football for my entire life, and I began playing the sport when I was 3. I played four years of varsity soccer at my high school, and I play intramural in college. I am a fan of many teams in Europe, Asia, and America that include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Liverpool FC (England)</li>
        <li>Middlesbrough FC (England)</li>
        <li>Fenerbahce (Turkey)</li>
        <li> Juventus (Italy)</li>
        <li>Lyon (France)</li>
        <li>Tokyo Verdy FC (Japan)</li>
        <li>River Plate (Argentina)</li>
        <li>Sao Paulo FC (Brazil)</li>
        <li>Bayern Munich (Germany)</li>
        <li>Real Oviedo (Spain)</li>
        <li>French, Irish, Japanese, and USA National Teams</li>         
    </ul>
    <p>I spend a lot of time following teams and studying the games. I also enjoy making films and writing scripts, some having to do with soccer.</p>
    <p>My goal in life is to become a filmmaker and travel the world displaying different cultures through my films. I would love to showcase football and how different countries view, play, and support the sport. In the end, I want to look back and see that I was able to use my passions to influence the world for the better.
