              My name is Cameron Hall and I am a sophomore at Michigan State University. I am majoring in Media and Information with a focus in Film Production and a minor in Fiction Filmmaking. I am also pursuing a major in Film Studies and a secondary minor in Information and Communication Technology and Development.

                <p>I spend a lot of time following teams and studying the games. I also enjoy making films and writing scripts, some having to do with soccer.</p>
                <p>My goal in life is to become a filmmaker and travel the world displaying different cultures through my films. I would love to showcase football and how different countries view, play, and support the sport. In the end, I want to look back and see that I was able to use my passions to influence the world for the better.
